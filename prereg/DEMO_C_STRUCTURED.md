# DEMO C (Structured Task) — Pre-Registered

## Claim
TRP training increases P on a structured task environment
beyond placebo/control, yielding higher effective time T.

## Task (fixed before run)
Choose and lock one:
- learning a fixed coding module
- solving a fixed problem set
- reading fixed text + recall
Task: ______________________

## Protocol
- Baseline 7 days
- TRP lever 14 days (single lever)
- Control 14 days (same schedule, no lever) OR shuffled schedule

## Metrics
- P from proxies (same as DEMO B)
- T = Σ R_t P_t dt with R_t fixed by task difficulty index

## Win Condition
P_TRP ≥ 1.4 × P_control
AND no RED leash events.

## Falsifiers
- Control matches TRP results
- Gains require changing proxies mid-trial
- Gains disappear under shuffle/null
