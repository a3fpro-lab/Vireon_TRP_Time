# DEMO B (Human P-Ladder) — Pre-Registered

## Claim
A single lever (mindfulness OR flow-engineering) increases P
measurably over baseline while KL leash remains bounded.

## Baseline
- 7 days no intervention
- P=1.0 defined by proxy mean

## Proxies (fixed)
Pick 3–5 and lock them here:
1. Focus minutes/day
2. Retention score next-day
3. Output/hour (code, writing, problems solved)
4. Fixed attention drill score
5. Subjective depth rating (0–10 after day)

## Leash Sensors (fixed)
1. Sleep hours/quality
2. Mood volatility 0–10
3. Irritability/conflict count
4. Risk/impulse 0–10
5. Somatic stress (HR/tension/appetite)

## Intervention
- Lever: __________ (choose ONE)
- Dose: __________
- Duration: 14 days
- No stacking during trial

## Win Condition
Median(P_intervention) ≥ 1.5 × Median(P_baseline)
AND KL leash zone never reaches RED.

## Falsifiers
- P rises only with sleep loss or volatility spike
- P rises but retention/output do not
- No repeatable gain across 2+ separate trials
